                    <h2> What is Python </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                        emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as
                        well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small
                        and large-scale projects.

                        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.</p>

                    <h2> What is JavaS </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
                        as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
                        intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can
                        run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. </p>
